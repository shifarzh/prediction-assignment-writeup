<h1>Prediction Assignment Writeup</h1>
<p>This HTML report summarizes the process of building a machine learning model using Random Forest to predict the manner in which barbell exercises were performed.</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Loaded and cleaned the data</li>
  <li>Partitioned the dataset</li>
  <li>Trained a Random Forest model with cross-validation</li>
  <li>Evaluated the model with confusion matrix</li>
  <li>Predicted on 20 new test cases</li>
</ol>
